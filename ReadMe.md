How to Run
To run the app, follow these steps:

Open two terminal windows.
Make sure you have npm installed.
In one terminal window, navigate to the Real Estate directory. If necessary, navigate first to "web hw2" and then to the respective directories.
In the other terminal window, navigate to the server directory.
Run npm install in both terminal windows to install dependencies. Dependencies include express, cors, react, react-router-dom, and jquery.
Next, run npm run dev in the Real Estate directory. This should start the app. To display the app, hold ctrl and click on the localhost link.
Finally, run npm run dev in the server terminal window. This should start the server on port 5000. You can view the information in the server by typing http://localhost:5000/api in your browser.
